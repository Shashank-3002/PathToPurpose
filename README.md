# 🌟 Path to Purpose – Life Countdown Tracker

**Path to Purpose** is a minimal yet powerful web tool designed to give users a life-altering perspective on time. Inspired by a thought-provoking moment on Instagram, this tool calculates the **estimated number of weeks** you and your loved ones (like parents) may have left—based on average life expectancy. It’s a reminder that **time is limited**, and every week counts.

> ⚠️ This isn’t just a calculator — it’s a wake-up call.

## 🚀 Purpose

While casually scrolling through Instagram, I stumbled upon a post that framed life in weeks. That visual struck me deeply. I calculated and realized:
- I have approximately **2,542 weeks** left to chase my dreams.
- My mom has about **1,726 weeks** left to witness my success.

This realization fueled the creation of **Path to Purpose** — to **help others reflect, realign, and act** before time slips away.

- Shows **how many weeks your parents have left** to witness your journey.
- Encourages people to **live intentionally**, not passively.
- Helps realign goals and values by creating a strong sense of urgency.
